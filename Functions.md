## 2. Create a Cron Job
### For this section I followed along your video with the Pubmed search.

1. After creating all the files I tried to run the action and got an error.
2. I fixed the error. I realized I had the wrong path to start the python file.

3. After I fixed that I was succesful in running the action.

## 3. Explore Functions as a Service (FaaS)
- Functions of a service provide the following benefits
  1. Focus more on code
  2. Pay for only the resources you use
  3. They are scaleable
   - For example if you have website or webapp and you have a needed function that may not be used as much as others. It could be more cost effective to run it using a FaaS
   - They also reduce the resources you need to manage significantly.
- limitations to consider are as follows
  1. I guess can be a Pro and Con is the lack of managed resources
  2. inability to maintain data after these functions run
  3. Overall general lag if functions arent used often.
